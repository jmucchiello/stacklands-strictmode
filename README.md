# Strict Mode

When enabled, no card transitions can be performed unless you have discovered the idea first.
The mod can be enabled/disabled in the Mod Options Screen and is disabled by default.

## Save Games

You can also activate this mod when starting a new game. The status of the mod in the save game overrides the setting in the Options screen.
A notification is displayed to show that the mod was active. You can use this to prove that your screen shots are authentic, if that interests you.

When you enable strict mode on the Start New Run screen, you can clear the save game slot as part of the new game.
When the notification popups up, it informs the viewer how many ideas were known when the save game was created.
