# Strict Mode
When *ON*, no card transitions can be performed unless you have discovered the idea first.
The mod can be enabled/disabled in the *Mod Options Screen* and is disabled by default.

## Save Games
You can also activate this mod when starting a new game. The status of the mod in the save game overrides the setting in the *Mod Options Screen*.
A notification is displayed to show that the mod was active. You can use this to prove that your screen shots are authentic, if that interests you.

When you enable **Strict Mode** on the *Start New Run* screen, you can clear the save game slot as part of the new game.
When the notification popups up, it informs the viewer how many ideas were known when the save game was created.

## Notifications
When a game is created or continued a notification is displayed to remind the player whether **Strict Mode** is enabled or not
and whether the setting is being pulled from the current save file or from the *Mod Options Screen*. You can turn this off in
*Mod Options Screen*. This option is set to *ON***** by default.
