# Strict Mode

When enabled, no card transitions can be performed unless you have discovered the idea first. When installed, this mod is disabled. You have to go into the options screen and turn it on. The game will restart whenever you turn this option on or off.

That's it. This mod is most difficult when you clear the save before starting a new game. You can't even make a stick until you find the idea for it. (It's in the Humble Beginnings card stack.)
